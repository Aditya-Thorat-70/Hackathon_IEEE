              Chemotherapy
            </h3>
            <p className="px-5 text-gray-600 py-3">
              Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses powerful drugs to destroy
              cancer cells. It works by targeting cells that divide rapidly,
              which includes cancer cells. It's usually given in cycles and can
              be administered orally or intravenously. Side effects may include
              fatigue, hair loss, and nausea. It’s a common treatment for many
              types of cancer.

              Dialysis

            <p className="px-5 text-gray-600 py-3">
              Dialysis is a procedure that removes waste, toxins, and excess
              fluids from the blood. It is used when the kidneys fail to perform
              their filtering function properly. There are two main types:
              hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Patients may need it
              multiple times per week. It helps manage symptoms of kidney
              failure but isn’t a cure.

              Vaccination
            </h3>
            <p className="px-5 text-gray-600 py-3">
              Vaccines train the immune system to recognize and fight specific
              infections. They are made using weakened or inactivated viruses or
              parts of pathogens. Vaccination is key to preventing diseases like
              measles, polio, and COVID-19. They are safe and undergo extensive
              testing. Mass vaccination helps in achieving herd immunity.

              Surgery
            </h3>
            <p className="px-5 text-gray-600 py-3">
              Surgery involves cutting into the body to treat diseases,
              injuries, or deformities. It can be elective, emergency, or for
              diagnostic purposes. Techniques range from open surgery to
              minimally invasive procedures. Anesthesia is used to prevent pain
              during the operation. Recovery time depends on the type and
              complexity of the surgery.
